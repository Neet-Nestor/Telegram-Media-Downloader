For videos, a progress bar will show on the bottom-right corder after you started downloading. For images and audios, there won't be a progress bar.

### Supported Webapp Versions
There are 2 different versions of telegram webapps:
- https://webk.telegram.org / https://web.telegram.org/k/ (**Recommended**)
- https://webz.telegram.org / https://web.telegram.org/a/

This script should work on both versions of webapp, but some features are only available in the /k/ version (such as voice message downloads). If certain features are not working, switching to the /k/ version is recommended.

### Check Downloading Progress
A progress bar will show on the bottom-right of the screen for videos. You can also check [DevTools console](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/open/) for logs.
